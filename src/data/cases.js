    history:
      "Sara is a 28-year-old junior marketing professional who appears composed at work while privately spiraling after a breakup that reignites childhood abandonment pain from emotionally distant parents.",

    voice:
      "Hi, I'm Sara. On paper I'm doing fine-hitting deadlines, grabbing coffee with the team-but the minute I'm alone it feels like the breakup proved I'm too much to love. I replay every conversation wondering what flaw finally pushed him away. I tell friends I'm busy because I can't bear the pity, and I fall asleep to podcasts so I don't hear the silence. I came to therapy because I'm tired of pretending I'm okay when inside I feel hollow and unworthy."

    voice:
      "I'm Michael. I spend all day keeping projects on track, and the second someone questions me I feel heat in my chest and I'm barking orders. I tell myself it's stress, but afterward I lie awake replaying the look on my wife's face when I snap. My dad drilled into me that only the best survives, so the idea that people see me as overreacting or weak is unbearable. I want to stop exploding before I burn everything down."

      "I'm Jason. Every meeting feels like a test I'm about to fail, so I stay quiet and then beat myself up for sounding useless. Friends invite me out, but I stare at the message until it's too late to respond. When I picture speaking up, my chest locks and this voice says, 'Don't expose how weird you are.' I'm exhausted from living in my head and I want to feel like I belong somewhere."

    voice:
      "Hey, I'm Carlos. I love my family, but one moment I'm joking with my wife and the next I'm punching a wall because she questioned me. At work, a look from a guy half my age can make me see red. I grew up learning you swing before you get swung on, but now I watch my little boy flinch when I shout. I want to figure out how to protect my pride without scaring the people I care about."

    practiceEdge: "Expect guilt to rush in the moment need or anger appears.",
    style:
      "Warm, polite tone; apologetic laughs; quick 'sorry' before needs; over-nodding; smile while upset; breath held then small sigh; hands smoothing clothing.",
    voice:
      "I'm Nina. My day starts before sunrise packing lunches and answering emails for other people, and by night I'm too tired to notice my own kids' texts. When I finally admit I need help, this wave of guilt crashes in and I call myself selfish. I don't even know what I like anymore. I'm afraid if I stop over-functioning, no one will want me, but I can't keep living on empty."

    voice:
      "I'm David. I built a career on being the man with answers, yet at home I'm met with eye rolls and accusations that I'm cold. The word 'narcissist' still stings because it exposes how hollow I feel when I'm not winning. My father praised results, not me, and I don't know how to be loved without performing. I'm terrified the people I care about will see the cracks and walk away."

Nights are worse-faces from overseas show up in my dreams, or memories from foster homes I've tried to forget. When someone asks how I am, 'fine' is all that comes out, because letting them see more feels dangerous. I'm here because feeling nothing is starting to feel like dying."
